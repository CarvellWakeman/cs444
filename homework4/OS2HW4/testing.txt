How to Test Assignment 4:

1) Apply patch file to kernel and rebuild kernel 

2) Boot Qemu 

2) From another terminal session cd into our submission folder:
   Scp -P 5526 mod.ko root@localhost:~
   Scp -P 5526 test.c root@localhost:~

3) While Qemu is launched , and after the files have been copied over to it using Scp run this command: 
   insmod mod.ko 
   This step starts testing the slob module by calling kmalloc and kfree in a loop

4) Now, compile test.c using gcc
   gcc test.c 

5) Run /.a.out and you should start getting messages regarding free space, total space and
   fragmentation involved. 

Please note that : when you build the kernel you will get fragmentation rates for best-fit. Snapshots showing fragmentation rates for first fit and best fit have been included in the submission folder.
