Kernel and VM command list:

Author: Rohan Barve

Work Log:

Here is a list of the following commands that were used to setup the kernel and VM qemu. These steps were followed in ascending order.

1. Created group folder mkdir /scratch/fall2017/26
cd /scratch/fall2017/26

2. Cloned yocto kernel
git clone git://git.yoctoproject.org/linux-yocto-3.19
cd linux-yocto-3.19

3.Changed the tag to the required version v3.19.2
git checkout 'v3.19.2'
cd ../

4. Next, cloned the required environment scripts so that qemu is setup correctly and be used at a later point. 
cp /scratch/files/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux* ./

5. Cloned, the needed kernel and filesystem which will be needed when launching qemu
cp /scratch/files/bzImage-qemux86.bin ./
cp /scratch/files/core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext4 ./

6. Now, we can build the kernel:
Sourced the correct environment script for the bash shell
source environment-setup-i586-poky-linux
cd linux-yocto-3.19

7. Clean out any previous builds with make clean

8. Copy the needed kernel config file 
cp /scratch/files/config-3.19.2-yocto-standard ./.config

9. Adjusted the kernel setting using: makemenuconfig. In general settings, changed "Local Version" to "-group26hw1". Saved the file as .config and exited menuconfig.

10. Compiled the kernel using: make -j4 bzImage. Used 4 threads.

11. Now, we are ready to test the kernel inside qemu and need to launch qemu with this command replacing the ???? with our group number 5526.
qemu-system-i386 -gdb tcp::5526 -S -nographic \
    -kernel linux-yocto-3.19/arch/x86/boot/bzImage \
    -drive file=core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext4,if=virtio \
    -enable-kvm -net none -usb -localtime --no-reboot \
    --append "root=/dev/vda rw console=ttyS0 debug"

12. This launches qemu in a halted state as it is waiting for us to launch a new terminal session to connect gdb to the specified tcp port we are working on. 

13. Open new terminal session and launch gdb. 
gdb

14. Within gdb connect to specified port: (gdb) target remote:5526

15. This step should result in the kernel booting and a login screen qemux86 appearing. The login is root and there is no password so I simply hit Enter.
